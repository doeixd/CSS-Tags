# Library Review (`review.md`)

This file contains a comprehensive review of the CSS framework library, including strengths assessment, identified issues, and detailed improvement suggestions.

## Overview

The review evaluates the library as a modern, comprehensive CSS component system featuring advanced features like OKLCH colors, CSS layers, design tokens, and declarative layout components.

## Review Structure

### Strengths
- Comprehensive design token system
- Modern CSS feature adoption (@property, @layer, container queries, @scope)
- Built-in theme support (light/dark mode, high contrast)
- Self-contained component architecture
- Declarative layout primitives
- Accessibility considerations

### Issues Identified
1. Import typos (`view-transitions.css` vs `view-transition.css`)
2. Naming inconsistencies (singular vs plural file references)
3. Redundant imports in `index.css`
4. Missing files (`components.css`, `utilities.css`)
5. Inconsistent layer assignments
6. Unused files (`main.css`)

### Improvement Suggestions

#### 1. Fix Existing Issues
- Correct import typos and naming inconsistencies
- Resolve redundant/missing imports
- Standardize layer assignments

#### 2. Organization and Structure
- Implement subdirectories (`core/`, `components/`, `utilities/`, `layouts/`, `themes/`)
- Update import paths in `index.css`
- Split large files (e.g., `palette.css` into color-family files)

#### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Extract critical CSS
- Remove unused code
- Add minification build step
- Consider lazy loading strategies

#### 4. Accessibility Enhancements
- Add ARIA attributes to components
- Implement focus management and trapping
- Expand high contrast mode coverage
- Conduct screen reader testing

#### 5. Documentation and Examples
- Create comprehensive README.md
- Document component APIs
- Enhance demo pages
- Add changelog

#### 6. Best Practices and Standards
- CSS validation and linting
- Semantic naming conventions
- Inline code comments
- Semantic versioning

#### 7. Testing and Quality Assurance
- Visual regression testing
- Cross-browser testing
- Accessibility auditing
- CSS property testing

#### 8. Build and Tooling
- Build scripts for concatenation/minification
- Package.json for dependency management
- CI/CD pipeline setup

#### 9. Future Enhancements
- TypeScript definitions
- Framework integration guides
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Internationalization support

## Implementation Priority

1. **High**: Fix existing issues for functionality
2. **Medium**: Improve organization and documentation
3. **Low**: Advanced features and tooling

## Purpose

This review serves as a roadmap for library improvement, focusing on maintainability, performance, accessibility, and developer experience while preserving the library's innovative modern CSS approach.
