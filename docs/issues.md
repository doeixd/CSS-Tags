# Issues Documentation (`issues.md`)

This file contains a comprehensive analysis of issues identified within the CSS framework library, focusing on structural problems, naming inconsistencies, and import errors.

## Overview

`issues.md` documents 7 major issues found during code review, including:

- File naming inconsistencies
- Broken import statements
- Redundant imports
- Missing files
- Layer assignment inconsistencies
- Unused files

## Documented Issues

### 1. Typo in index.css for view-transitions.css import

**Problem**: `index.css` imports `view-transitions.css` (plural) but file is `view-transition.css` (singular)

**Impact**: Broken import prevents view transition styles from loading

**Recommendation**: Correct import to match actual filename

### 2. Inconsistent Naming in view-transition.css

**Problem**: File named singular but internal comments use plural

**Impact**: Developer confusion when navigating codebase

**Recommendation**: Rename file to `view-transitions.css` for consistency

### 3. Inconsistent Naming in view-transition.js

**Problem**: Similar naming inconsistency in JavaScript file

**Impact**: Continued developer confusion

**Recommendation**: Rename to `view-transitions.js`

### 4. Redundant components.css and utilities.css Imports

**Problem**: General imports followed by specific component imports

**Impact**: Unnecessary redundancy and potential cascade issues

**Recommendation**: Remove redundant imports or restructure import hierarchy

### 5. Missing components.css and utilities.css Files

**Problem**: Imported files don't exist in filesystem

**Impact**: Broken imports prevent intended styles from loading

**Recommendation**: Create files or remove imports

### 6. Inconsistent Layering for base.css and mixins.css

**Problem**: Some files use explicit layer() while others don't

**Impact**: Unclear cascade order and inconsistent patterns

**Recommendation**: Use explicit layer assignments consistently

### 7. Potential for Unused Files (main.css)

**Problem**: `main.css` exists but isn't imported

**Impact**: Potentially unused or orphaned styles

**Recommendation**: Investigate and either import or remove

## Structure
